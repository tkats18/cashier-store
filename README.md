> As a *cashier*, I would like to open a receipt so that, I can start serving customers.

> As a *cashier*, I would like to add items to an open receipt so that, I can calculate how much the customer needs to pay.

> As a *customer*, I would like to see a receipt with all my items so that, I know how much I have to pay.

> As a *customer*, I would like to pay (by cash or card) for a receipt so that, I can receive my items.

> As a *cashier*, I would like to close the paid receipt so that, I can start serving the next customer.

> As a *store manager*, I would like to make X reports so that, I can see the current state of the store.

## Technical Details

- Store can sell items as singles
- Store can sell items as batches/packs. (think 6-pack of beer cans :D)
- Store can have discounts of various types:
  * Items can have discount
  * Batches/packs can have discount (e.g. if a customer buys a pack of tissues they get -10% off the total price)
  * Combination of items can have discount (e.g. if a customer buys bread and cheese together they get -5% on each)
- Persistence is out of scope (store the data in memory) but designs your solution in a way that adding persistence will be straightforward
- For simplicity X reports only contain revenue and count of each item sold.
- For simplicity Z report only "clears" the Cash Register. After this operation, revenue and the number of items sold are zero.


## Simulation

Repeat:
  - Customers with randomly selected items arrive at POS.
  - Cashier opens the receipt.
  - Cashier registers items one by one in the receipt.
  - Once the cashier registers all items, print the receipt (see example below)
  - Customer pays (picks payment method randomly)
    * with cash: print "Customer paid with cash"
    * with card: print "Customer paid with card"
  - Once the cashier confirms payment they close the receipt.

After every 20th customer, prompt the store manager if they want to make X report. A simple y/n question will suffice.
  * If they pick "y" print out X Report (see example below)
  * If they pick "n" continue the simulation

After every 100th customer, prompt the store manager if they want to end the shift. A simple y/n question will suffice.
  * If they pick "y" simulate cashier making Z Report.
  * If they pick "n" continue the simulation

After three shifts, end the simulation.
